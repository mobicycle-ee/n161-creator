# Legal Survival Guide - Style Guide

## Core Voice: Investigative Journalist
Like "Nickel and Dimed" meets UK court system - documenting systematic failures through specific evidence.

## Writing Principles

### 1. EVIDENCE-BASED ACCUSATIONS
❌ "They always delay orders"
✅ "FOI request 2023/1847 revealed average seal time: 3-6 months"

❌ "Judges hate self-represented people"  
✅ "Court observation data: QCs speak average 45 minutes, self-represented get 3 minutes"

### 2. SPECIFIC VILLAINS
❌ "The system is broken"
✅ "HMCTS policy directive 2019/04 created this barrier"

❌ "They're all corrupt"
✅ "The JCIO refused 98% of complaints in 2023 (Annual Report, p.47)"

### 3. SHAREABLE FACTS
Each chapter needs "Did you know..." moments:
- "Court fees increased 600% since 2010"
- "You have 21 days to appeal but orders take 90 days to arrive"
- "Form N244 costs £273 just to ask a question"

### 4. SURVIVAL TACTICS (Not Despair)
❌ "You're screwed if this happens"
✅ "When this happens: 1) File Form N244, 2) Request fee remission using EX160, 3) Email court.delivery@justice.gov.uk"

### 5. CASE LAW AS WEAPONS
❌ "Some case says you can't appeal"
✅ "Sivasubramaniam v Wandsworth [2003] blocks Circuit Judge appeals unless..."

## Tone Examples

### Opening a Chapter:
"In 2023, 14,000 people tried to file urgent applications. 93% waited over three weeks. This chapter shows you why—and what to do about it."

### Explaining a Trap:
"The court charges £273 for Form N244. If you pick the wrong category in CE-File, you lose the money. No refunds. Here's the internal memo (HMCTS/2021/INT/043) that confirms this policy."

### Providing Solutions:
"Document everything. Email yourself after each call. Reference: CPR 3.9, Mitchell v News Group [2013]. They can't deny what's in writing."

## Structure for Each Trap

1. **The Fact** - Statistics or FOI data
2. **The Proof** - Case name, policy number, or document reference  
3. **The Experience** - What actually happens to you
4. **The Counter** - Specific form or procedure to fight back
5. **The Reality** - Success rate with this counter-measure

## Language Rules

### Use Simple Words
- "judge" not "judiciary"
- "lawyer" not "legal representative"  
- "deadline" not "limitation period"
- "cancel" not "set aside"

### Active Voice
- "The court refused your application"
- "Judge Smith dismissed the claim"
- "HMCTS charges £420"

### Present Tense for Current Practice
- "They charge £273"
- "This takes 3-6 months"
- "98% are refused"

### Specific Numbers
- "£420" not "hundreds"
- "21 days" not "a few weeks"
- "98%" not "almost all"

## What to Avoid

❌ Emotional language without evidence
❌ Personal anecdotes as main proof
❌ Vague timelines
❌ "Everyone knows" statements
❌ Legal jargon without translation
❌ Hopeless conclusions

## What to Include

✅ FOI request numbers
✅ Case citations with year
✅ Form numbers with costs
✅ Email addresses that work
✅ Statistics from official reports
✅ Policy document references
✅ Specific department names
✅ Real judge names (public record)

## Sample Paragraph

"The Ministry of Justice's own data (Table 2.4, Civil Justice Statistics Quarterly, Q4 2023) shows seal times averaging 91 days. But CPR 52.12 gives you 21 days to appeal from the sealed order date. This impossible timeline affects 4,200 cases annually. When it happens to you, immediately file Form N161 with a covering letter citing Hertfordshire CC v Davies [2017] for extension of time. Success rate: 31%."

## Remember
You're not writing a rant. You're writing an investigation. Every accusation needs a receipt.
